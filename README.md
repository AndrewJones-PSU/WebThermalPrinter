# Web Thermal Printer

This is a node.js application that acts as a web interface for a thermal receipt printer. This is specifically tuned for
the TM-T20ii, but is configurable to run on any ESC-POS based printer.

Currently in development and a WIP, assume everything in this repo is experimental and doesn't work quite right yet,
because it probably doesn't.
